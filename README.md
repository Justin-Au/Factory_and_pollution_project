# The Effect of Illegal Factories on Water Pollution
This research project tries to analyze the damage brings by illegal factories on farmland in Taiwan. This is a serious problem since long ago. Factories illegally occuiped farmlands to reduce their costs. As they are not being regulated by the government, the inappropriate design of waste water discharge facilities would lead to severe influence on the quality of surface water and groundwater. This project uses regression model to evaluate the relationship between illegal factories and water pollution. Ordinary least squares is adopted first. Then two-stage least squares with an instrumental variable is chosen to handle endogeneity. The results show that more illegally occupied farmland area by factories contributes to a higher concentration of arsenic, lead, manganese and zinc in river and groundwater.
